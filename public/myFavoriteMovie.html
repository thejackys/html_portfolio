<h3>spider man animation 1&2 by sony</h3>
<hr/?>
<p> The most well animated movies by far. 
    There's no other artistic style animated movie other than 
disney style before sony has published their movie.
It was a great and successful try for sony. 
It works and show that artistic style animation can still
get a good views.</p>


<h3>In & out</h3>
<hr/>
<p> A movie made by pixels which thoroughly showed how 
    a teenager would face during their transition from kids.
    Main character's emotion is animated into 5 different 
    character and all of them have different personalitiy, 
    how they interact is just so fun!
